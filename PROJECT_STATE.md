# PROJECT_STATE.md

Reference doc for reorienting after context loss. Reflects the actual code in
the working tree on `main` (last commit `81c43bc`, plus this session's
uncommitted wall-height fix, view/navigation features, and stair geometry fix
— see §6 for the running list of what's still uncommitted). Reference-style,
not prose. **Read the cited files to confirm before relying on any detail.**

## 1. What the project is

A browser-based **3D flat / housing configurator** built with **TypeScript +
Three.js**, bundled with **Vite**. It is a thesis tool: the user places
modular rooms, furniture, and stairs on a 0.6 m grid across multiple floors,
viewed in an axonometric (isometric) or straight-down plan projection. Rooms
snap to the grid, can be rotated in 90° increments, moved, and deleted; the
app renders rooms as hollow "dollhouse" shells with a camera-aware cutaway so
interiors are visible. A whole-dwelling adjacency graph (rooms/clusters/stairs
as nodes, touch + cross-floor stair edges) feeds an advisory, on-demand layout
rules engine and a toggleable bubble-diagram view. Projects save/load to JSON.
It is a work-in-progress research artifact, not a production app.

## 2. Core architecture — systems and the files that own them

| System | Owner file(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Grid + occupancy + coordinate conversion | `src/core/grid.ts` | `Grid` class: dims, occupancy `Map<"cx,cz", instanceId>`, `holeCells` (stairwell voids), `gridToWorld`/`worldToGrid` (grid centred on world origin), `canPlace`/`plateAvailable`/`occupy`/`free`/`setHoles`/`ownerAt`/`inBounds`/`resize`. `CELL_SIZE = 0.6`. |
| Room / module / stair definitions | `src/core/modules.ts` | `MODULE_DEFS` registry, `ModuleDef` (`category: "module" \| "room" \| "stair"`), `lShape()`/`rect()` footprint helpers, `rotateCell`/`rotatedCells`/`occupiedCells`, `ROOM_HEIGHT = 4`. `MODULE_LIST` (furniture), `ROOM_LIST`, `STAIR_LIST`. |
| Placed-instance store (place/move/rotate/delete) | `src/core/store.ts` | `ModuleStore`: single source mutating occupancy + scene together. `instances: Map<id, ModuleInstance>`, `onChange` hook, `extraPlacementCheck?` (cross-floor stair rule, set by FloorManager), `canPlaceInstance()`, `reconcileAfterResize`, `maxRoomHeightCells`. |
| Mesh building: solid cubes, **room shells**, connector tiles, **concave-corner wall logic**, **window panel-kit + glazing** | `src/scene/moduleMesh.ts` | `buildModuleMesh()` routes: `category==="stair"` → `buildStairGroup` (stairMesh.ts); connector → tile; room → `buildRoomShell` (hollow open-top shell, walls built directly at the floor's true height — see §2b); else solid cubes. `buildBoundaryWalls()` is the shared clean-corner wall generator (exported; reused by clusters), and — given a per-edge `windows` map — replaces a windowed edge's solid segment with sill/lintel panels + a glazing pane (see §2d). `rebuildRoomWalls()` rebuilds just a room's wall+glazing meshes in place when height or windows change. `makeGlassMaterial()`. `WALL_T = 0.1`, `FLOOR_H = 0.15`. |
| **Rule-driven window generator** (derived, per room) | `src/core/windows.ts` | `computeWindows(cells, roomTypeId, floorHeight, occupied, entranceEdgeKeys) → WindowPlan`. Pure computation (no Three.js). `WINDOW_CONFIG` per-type table (target ratio + variant). See §2d. |
| **Stair geometry** (180° dogleg, two floors) | `src/scene/stairMesh.ts` | `buildStairGroup()`. See §2a. |
| Dynamic dollhouse **cutaway** | `src/scene/cutaway.ts` | `updateCutaway()` hides wall meshes whose `userData.wallNormal · viewDir > THRESHOLD (0.12)`; throttled (recompute on camera move or `markCutawayDirty()`). Unaffected by the §2b wall-height mechanism (walls are rebuilt, not scaled — `wallNormal` tags are untouched either way) or the top view (a straight-down `viewDir` dots to ~0 against every wall normal, which are always in the XZ plane — every wall stays visible, reading correctly as a plan). |
| **Multi-floor** support, stacking, **wall/stair height reconciliation**, **window generation**, **floor visibility**, **zoom-to-extent box** | `src/core/floor.ts`, `src/core/floorManager.ts` | See §2b (height), §2d (windows), §5 (visibility/framing). `Floor` = own grid + `ModuleStore` + `GridView` + `HoleView` + `EntranceView` + `entrances[]` + `windowStats` + `clusterGroup`, all under one `group`. `FloorManager`: stack, active floor, vertical stacking offsets, dim inactive floors, stairwell holes, `rebuildWalls()` (walls + windows), floor visibility, content bounding box. `DEFAULT_FLOOR_CELLS = 4`, `CLEARANCE_CELLS = 1`. |
| Grid dots / floor visual | `src/scene/gridView.ts` | Intersection dots + border; `setDimmed`. |
| Stairwell **hole** rendering | `src/scene/holeView.ts` | `HoleView`: recessed dark panel + outline per stairwell opening (merged per connected component). Purely visual; occupancy blocking is `Grid.holeCells`. |
| Ground-floor **entrance** marker rendering | `src/scene/entranceView.ts` | `EntranceView`: renders `Floor.entrances` as door markers on exterior edges; meshes tagged `userData.entranceId` for highlight lookup. |
| **Entrance placement** interaction | `src/interaction/entranceController.ts`, `src/core/entrance.ts` | `EntranceController`: ghost preview + click-to-place (ground floor only) + Escape to cancel. `Entrance { id, cell, side }`. Entrances are also SELECTABLE/DELETABLE (via `SelectionController`, see §2f): click a marker to select, Delete to remove. `Floor.removeEntrance(id)`; `EntranceView.markers`/`setSelectedId`. |
| **Undo / redo history** (snapshot-based) | `src/core/history.ts` | `History`: undo/redo stacks of serialized-project snapshots (cap 20), commit-after-action model, restore via the import rebuild path. See §2f. |
| **Exterior-edge detection** (reusable) | `src/core/exteriorEdges.ts` | `exteriorEdges(cells, occupied) → BoundaryEdge[]`. Standalone/generic: consumed by entrance placement/validity, the daylight rules (D1/D2 via `GraphNode.hasExteriorEdge`), and reserved for a future facade/window task. |
| **Circulation / Outdoor cluster merging** | `src/scene/clusterShells.ts` (+ `src/core/cluster.ts`) | `rebuildClusterShells()` groups connector cells by `def.cluster`, flood-fills connected components (`connectedComponents`), draws ONE merged boundary shell per cluster (outer walls only) via `buildBoundaryWalls`. |
| **Voxel furniture prop** system | `src/scene/props/*` | `voxelProp.ts` (format + library), `place.ts` (transform/tiling/clip/wall-clip + merged `InstancedMesh`), `kitchen.ts` (Kitchen layout), `index.ts` (`PROP_BUILDERS` registry). Data in `src/scene/props/data/*.json`. |
| **Whole-dwelling adjacency graph** (rules + bubble-diagram data) | `src/core/adjacencyGraph.ts` | `computeDwellingGraph(floors) → DwellingGraph`. See §2c. |
| **Layout rules engine** (advisory, on-demand) | `src/core/rules.ts` | `RULES: Rule[]`, `validate(graph)`, `computeEntranceDepths(graph)`. See §8 for the full current rule table. |
| Rules-violation **3D highlighting** | `src/scene/highlight.ts` | `applyRoomHighlights(floors, violations)` / `clearRoomHighlights(floors)`: emissive tint on implicated room/cluster/stair shells + entrance markers, across ALL floors, resolved via `parseDwellingNodeId`. |
| Bubble-diagram **view** | `src/ui/graphView.ts` | Toggleable full-screen 2D force-directed node-edge diagram of the DwellingGraph; entry-node rings, cross-floor stair stubs, depth badges, highlight/depth overlays. |
| Validation report panel | `src/ui/validationPanel.ts` | `renderValidationPanel()`: grouped hard/soft/note issue list + the entrance-depth metric summary. |
| **Project save / load** | `src/core/projectIO.ts` | `serializeProject(floors) → ProjectFile`, `parseProject(text) → ParsedProject` (tolerant/versioned). See §3. Camera state and floor visibility are deliberately excluded (view state, not design state). |
| Sidebar palette / grid-size / floor tabs / floor-visibility toggles | `src/ui/palette.ts` | Rebuilt on floor-state change. |
| Scene/camera/lights, **zoom-to-extent framing** | `src/scene/sceneSetup.ts` | Orthographic camera, `frameBox(box, direction)`. See §5. |
| Interaction | `src/interaction/picker.ts`, `dragDrop.ts`, `selection.ts` | Raycast picking (scoped to the ACTIVE floor's store only — this is also why floor visibility needs no picker-side filtering, see §5), palette→canvas placement, select/move/rotate/delete of modules AND entrances. `dragDrop`/`selection` take an `onAfterAction` callback (fires after a committed mutation → undo snapshot, see §2f); `selection` takes an `EntranceSelectionAdapter` for entrance select/delete. |
| Wiring / render loop / view-mode orchestration | `src/main.ts` | Constructs everything; `animate()` renders 3D or drives the graph view; owns Reset View, plan-mode, diagram-mode toggle logic (mutually exclusive, see §5), and the undo/redo history wiring (§2f). Default grid 16×16. |

**Concave-corner wall logic** (part of `buildBoundaryWalls`): walls are inset to
the INTERIOR side of their boundary line (no protrusion). N/S walls (run in x)
take full length and "own" corner squares; E/W walls (run in z) are trimmed by
one wall thickness at any end where the same cell also has a perpendicular
boundary (convex corner). At concave corners the two walls belong to different
cells and meet edge-to-edge with no overlap. Walls are grouped into ≤4 merged
meshes by outward normal (±x, ±z), each tagged `userData.wallNormal` for
cutaway. Unaffected by which height value the caller passes in (§2b) — the
XZ tracing/corner math is independent of `fullH`.

### 2a. Stair geometry (`stairMesh.ts`)

180° dogleg: two 1-cell-wide flights (lane A / lane B) run side by side in
opposite directions, joined by a full-width half-landing at the far end.
Footprint 2×6 cells (1.2 m × 3.6 m). 20 risers @ 150 mm total rise (3.0 m),
split 10 + 10 by the landing at 1.5 m; 9 goings @ 300 mm per flight (2.7 m
run). All three pieces (flight 1, flight 2, landing) are solid down to the
ground (not a thin folded plate), so the upper flight reads as grounded.
Each piece is an extruded 2D profile (`profileGeometry()`, via
`THREE.ExtrudeGeometry`) merged into one mesh.

Built at a fixed `REFERENCE_STAIR_RISE = 3.0 m`; `FloorManager` rescales
`group.scale.y` per instance to the floor's real height (`updateStairScales()`).
Unlike walls (§2b, which now build directly at true height), a stair's
scale-driven rise is semantically intended — a taller floor genuinely means
taller risers, not a build-height bug — so it deliberately stays a runtime
rescale. The landing sits at exactly half the reference rise, so uniform
y-scaling keeps it at true mid-height for any floor height.

**Winding fix (this session):** flight 1's point list traced its profile
CLOCKWISE while flight 2 and the landing traced theirs COUNTER-CLOCKWISE
(`ExtrudeGeometry` treats CCW as "outward"), so flight 1's normals came out
inverted — masked from disappearing only by a `DoubleSide` material hack, but
lit backwards, which read as a shaded wedge/ramp artifact at the flight-1-to-
landing seam. Fixed by reversing flight 1's point order (`f1.reverse()`, same
boundary, opposite traversal) to match the other two pieces; the `DoubleSide`
workaround was removed (material is now default `FrontSide`). Verified via
riser-normal sampling (`(0,0,-1)` on flight 1, `(0,0,+1)` on flight 2, both
physically correct for their climb direction) and a downward-raycast
watertightness sweep (no culling holes beyond the intentional `STEP_INSET`
lane gaps).

### 2b. Wall / floor-to-floor height

`FloorManager.floorHeight(floor)` (private) = `(max(DEFAULT_FLOOR_CELLS,
floor.store.maxRoomHeightCells) + CLEARANCE_CELLS) * CELL_SIZE` — the vertical
floor-to-floor spacing used both for stacking (`recomputeStack()`) and for
wall height.

**Walls are built directly at their floor's true height — no scale hack.**
(An earlier version of this fix tagged wall meshes with `userData.
wallBaseHeight` and rescaled `scale.y` in a FloorManager pass; that was
replaced this session with true-height geometry, since a hidden scale factor
would have complicated the upcoming window/door band-slicing feature and
distorted any future wall texture.) `buildBoundaryWalls()` (moduleMesh.ts)
still takes an explicit `fullH` param — nothing about its XZ boundary-tracing/
concave-corner logic changed — but every CALLER now passes the floor's real
`floorHeight(floor)` instead of a fixed reference constant:
- `ModuleStore.wallHeightProvider?: () => number` (set by `FloorManager.
  createFloor()` to `() => this.floorHeight(floor)`, same pattern as the
  existing `extraPlacementCheck`) — `buildModuleMesh()`/`buildRoomShell()`
  build a NEW or ROTATED room's walls at the correct height from the start.
- `rebuildClusterShells(floor, grid, wallHeight)` — takes an explicit height
  param (was the fixed `FULL_H = ROOM_HEIGHT * CELL_SIZE` constant); fed
  `floorHeight(floor)` from `store.onChange`. Cluster shells already fully
  rebuild from occupancy on every change, so this needed no new rebuild
  trigger, just the correct height value.
- `FloorManager.rebuildWalls()` (private, replaces the old
  `updateWallHeights()`; called from `syncStairsAndHoles()` right after
  `updateStairScales()` — same trigger, same frequency, on every place/move/
  rotate/delete/resize) walks every ROOM instance (`category==="room"`, not a
  connector) on each floor and calls `rebuildRoomWalls(inst.group, inst.def,
  inst.rotation, floorHeight(floor))` (exported from moduleMesh.ts) —
  removes and disposes the group's existing `userData.isWall`-tagged
  children and rebuilds them via `buildBoundaryWalls()` at the target height.
  Floor slab and interior props are untouched; the room's existing shared
  `userData.material` is reused (verified: selection/dim tinting survives
  the rebuild, since it's the same material object, not a fresh one).
  Reconciles EVERY room on the floor unconditionally (not just the one just
  placed) — this is what makes an existing room's walls follow suit if some
  OTHER room's placement changes the floor's height. Stairs are excluded
  (their `group.scale.y` rise-scaling in `updateStairScales()` is
  semantically intended — a taller floor means taller risers — and stays
  untouched).

Verified: `scale.y === 1` on every wall mesh (room shells AND cluster
shells) after place/rotate/floor-add, wall tops still land exactly on the
next floor's slab start (zero gap, same bounding-box check as before),
selection tint survives an in-place rebuild.

**Implication for future work:** wall geometry is now correctly sized at
build time — a window/door band-slicing feature (or a future wall texture)
can compute against a wall mesh's actual dimensions directly, with no hidden
scale factor to account for.

### 2c. Whole-dwelling adjacency graph (`adjacencyGraph.ts`)

`computeDwellingGraph(floors: Floor[]) → DwellingGraph` spans ALL floors (not
just the active one). Node ids are namespaced `<floor>/<rawId>`
(`dwellingNodeId`/`parseDwellingNodeId`) since per-floor instance/cluster ids
collide across floors.

**Stairs are graph nodes** (`kind: "stair"`), not a same-floor-to-next-floor
shortcut: a stair gets ordinary same-floor ("bottom") edges from the generic
touch-edge pass (whatever touches its footprint on its own floor) PLUS
`viaStair: true` ("top") edges to whatever touches its footprint projected
onto the floor above. A room on floor N reaching a room on floor N+1 routes
THROUGH the stair node (one extra hop vs. the old direct-shortcut model) —
same reachable set, but the stair itself becomes inspectable (ST1/ST2).

Entrances are floor-0-only, RE-VALIDATED on every graph build (not cached):
`EntranceStatus.blocked` is true if the host cell no longer resolves to a
room/cluster, or the edge is no longer exterior (via `exteriorEdges` against
the floor's full occupied-cell set) — so a room built later against an
existing entrance's edge correctly invalidates it. `entryIds` = every
non-blocked entrance's host node id (multiple entrances allowed; "any one
entrance reaches it" is sufficient for reachability, see rules.ts's doc
comment).

`GraphNode.hasExteriorEdge` is computed once per floor (post-pass, reusing
`exteriorEdges` against the floor's full occupied set) and consumed by the
daylight rules (D1/D2) rather than recomputed per-rule.

`GraphNode.glazing?: GlazingStat` (rooms only) carries the derived window
generator's achieved-vs-target glazing, read from `floor.windowStats` (§2d) —
consumed by the W1 rule rather than recomputing windows.

### 2d. Rule-driven windows (`windows.ts`, exterior edges only)

Windows are **DERIVED, never stored** — regenerated from room type + exterior
edges on every wall rebuild, exactly like cluster shells and stair holes.
Nothing new is serialized; export/import reproduces identical windows because
they're a pure function of placement (verified by round-trip). **Exterior
edges only** — interior walls stay full solid; doors / interior openings are a
deliberate LATER task.

**Generator** (`computeWindows(cells, roomTypeId, floorHeight, occupied,
entranceEdgeKeys) → WindowPlan`, pure, no Three.js):
- Per-type policy in `WINDOW_CONFIG` (tunable): Living/Recreation → ratio 1/6,
  full-height; Bedroom S/L → 1/10, framed; Kitchen → fixed one 2-edge band,
  framed; Bathroom/Circulation/Outdoor (absent from the table) → none.
- Targets a glazing-AREA ratio of the room's floor area (floorArea =
  cellCount × 0.36 m²). Per-edge glazing = 0.6 × (floorHeight − 0.9)
  full-height, or 0.6 × (floorHeight − 1.8) framed. `edgesNeeded =
  ceil(area × ratio ÷ perEdge)`.
- **2-edge minimum (1200 mm), enforced — no 1-edge windows ever**: a computed
  1 rounds up to 2; a "need exactly 1 more" is absorbed by extending/overshoot
  so a 1-edge band is never emitted.
- **Edge selection**: exterior edges (`exteriorEdges`, minus any coinciding
  with an entrance — a door wins that edge) grouped into continuous straight
  same-side runs (`buildRuns` — a run never turns a corner, so bands don't
  wrap corners). Longest run first; band centred on the run and grown to the
  remaining need (still ≥2), then the next-longest run. Insufficient exterior
  supply → glaze what's possible; the shortfall is flagged by W1, not forced.
- Output `WindowPlan`: `edges: Map<absoluteEdgeKey, WindowVariant>` +
  `GlazingStat { targetRatio, achievedRatio, belowTarget }`.

**Panel kit** (built in `buildBoundaryWalls`, moduleMesh.ts): a windowed edge's
full-height solid segment is replaced by a **sill** panel (0→900 mm, always), an
optional **lintel** panel (framed variant: top 900 mm; full-height variant omits
it and the floor slab above acts as lintel), and a translucent **glazing** pane
filling the gap. Panel heights are ABSOLUTE (stay 900 mm on taller floors; the
glazing gap absorbs extra height) — this is why walls are now true-height
geometry (§2b), so the bands are computed against real dimensions. Sill/lintel
are still SOLID wall (same shared room material, merged into the same per-normal
wall mesh → they tint/dim/cutaway exactly like wall); glazing uses a per-room
`makeGlassMaterial()` (translucent, `depthWrite:false`, `renderOrder:1`,
`baseColor` so dimming fades it). Glass meshes carry the SAME
`userData.wallNormal` tag as solid walls, so the cutaway hides panels + glass
together with their face (verified).

**Integration**: `FloorManager.rebuildWalls()` computes the floor's occupied set
(rooms + clusters + stairs) and floor-0 entrance edges, then per room calls
`computeWindows`, converts the ABSOLUTE windowed edges → LOCAL edge keys (abs −
origin; side unchanged since the room group isn't rotated), and passes them into
`rebuildRoomWalls(..., localWindows)`. The achieved-vs-target `GlazingStat` is
stashed on `floor.windowStats` (instanceId → stat) for W1. Windows ride the
existing wall-rebuild pass, so move/rotate/delete of any room regenerates them
automatically. Entrance placement doesn't go through `store.onChange`, so it
calls `FloorManager.refreshWalls()` (public) to re-skip the door's edge. Cluster
shells (Circulation/Outdoor) never get windows.

### 2e. Undo / redo (snapshot history, `history.ts`)

Snapshot-based, leveraging that all DESIGN state is tiny serializable
source-of-truth (`projectIO`) and all DERIVED state rebuilds from it through the
same code paths as manual building. A snapshot is a serialized-project JSON
string; a restore is the project-import rebuild path.

`History` (core/history.ts) holds `undoStack`/`redoStack` of snapshot strings
(cap **20**) plus `lastState` (the serialized state as of the last commit).
Constructed with `serialize`, `restore`, `onChange` callbacks.
- **commit()** — called AFTER each mutating user action. Serializes current; if
  unchanged from `lastState` it's a NO-OP (so failed placements, invalid moves,
  same-cell drops, collision-blocked rotates record nothing); otherwise pushes
  the previous `lastState` onto undo, adopts the new one, and clears redo.
- **undo()/redo()** — swap states between the stacks and re-apply via `restore`
  (guarded so restore never re-enters commit).

**Commit hook points** (each = one snapshot): module place (`DragDropController.
onUp`), move/rotate/delete + entrance delete (`SelectionController`, via its
`onAfterAction` callback), entrance place (the `EntranceController.onPlaced`
callback in main), floor add/delete, grid resize, project import — all wired in
main to `commitHistory = () => history.commit()`. A multi-step drag is ONE
action: `store.move` and the commit fire only in `onPointerUp`, never per
`pointermove`, so a whole gesture is a single snapshot (and an invalid drop
commits nothing).

**Restore** (`restoreState` in main): `JSON.parse` → `floors.loadProject(data)`
(the exact import rebuild path — floors recreated, instances re-placed via
`store.place`, all derived state rebuilt), then re-apply VIEW state that the
snapshot doesn't carry: keep the active floor (clamped if the stack shrank) and
per-floor visibility (by index). Clears selection + any stale validation.
Camera is untouched (loadProject doesn't move it). Plan mode is exited only if
the floor-stack shape changed (its per-index bookkeeping would otherwise be
stale — matches `onStructureChange`).

**Explicitly OUTSIDE history** (never snapshotted, never changed by undo):
camera, Reset View, plan-mode toggle, floor visibility, active-floor switch,
selection, diagram toggle, Check Layout — all VIEW state.

**Controls**: Ctrl/Cmd+Z undo; Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z and Ctrl/Cmd+Y redo (main's
window keydown, ignored while typing in sidebar inputs); plus `#undo-btn` /
`#redo-btn` in the viewport (bottom-left), enabled/disabled from
`history.canUndo`/`canRedo`.

### 2f. Entrance selection / deletion (`selection.ts` + `EntranceView`)

Entrances are first-class selectable objects, handled by `SelectionController`
alongside modules (mutually exclusive selection, shared Delete/Escape). An
injected `EntranceSelectionAdapter` (built in main) does the entrance-specific
work: `pick(x,y)` (raycasts `Floor.entranceMarkers`, gated to when floor 0 is
active), `setSelected(id)` (marker emissive highlight via
`EntranceView.setSelectedId`), `remove(id)` (`Floor.removeEntrance` +
`FloorManager.refreshWalls` so the freed edge may regain a window +
`clearValidation`). Clicking a marker selects it (deselecting anything else);
Delete removes it; Escape deselects. Both place and delete are undoable (§2e).
Deleting the last entrance empties `entryIds`, returning validation to the E1
"place an entrance" gate with no stale highlight/report.

## 3. Key data structures / formats (written out)

### Cell (`grid.ts`)
```ts
interface Cell { cx: number; cz: number }   // integer grid coords
const CELL_SIZE = 0.6;                       // metres per cell
// gridToWorld: world centre of a cell; grid is centred on world origin.
```

### Room / module / stair definition (`modules.ts`)
```ts
type ModuleType = string;                       // id; rooms/furniture/stairs share one type-space
type Category = "module" | "room" | "stair";

interface ConnectionEdge {           // SCAFFOLDING ONLY — unused by any logic
  side: "north" | "south" | "east" | "west";
  allowed: boolean;
}

interface ModuleDef {
  type: ModuleType;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: Category;
  group?: string;          // UI grouping label, e.g. "Circulation"
  color: number;           // hex int (also used as room-type colour everywhere)
  cells: Cell[];           // footprint relative to origin (0,0) at rotation 0
  height: number;          // in cells: furniture = 1, rooms = ROOM_HEIGHT (4), stair = 1 (nominal — see §2a)
  connectionEdges?: ConnectionEdge[];  // scaffolding, unused
  cluster?: string;        // "circulation" | "outdoor" for connector merging
}
// ROOM_HEIGHT = 4 cells = 2.4 m — the def's OWN nominal height, used as the
// fallback when no floor height is supplied. Built walls actually reach the
// floor's true floor-to-floor height (see §2b), which is >= this.
```
Registry: `MODULE_DEFS`; lists `MODULE_LIST` (furniture), `ROOM_LIST`,
`STAIR_LIST` (currently one entry: the dogleg). Rotation:

//   for the stair "plate must be clear on the floor above" rule.
```

### Entrance (`entrance.ts`, `exteriorEdges.ts`)
```ts
type Side = "north" | "south" | "east" | "west";

  variant: WindowVariant | null;
}
function computeWindows(cells, roomTypeId, floorHeight, occupied, entranceEdgeKeys): WindowPlan;
const WINDOW_CONFIG: Record<roomTypeId, { targetRatio; variant; fixedEdges? }>;
// SILL_H = 0.9, LINTEL_H = 0.9, MIN_WINDOW_EDGES = 2 (all absolute metres/edges).
```

```ts
interface GraphNode {
  id: string;             // dwelling-unique: `${floor}/${rawId}`
  rawId: string;          // room/stair instance id, or `cluster:<key>:<min-cell>`

```

### Layout rules (`rules.ts`)
```ts
type Severity = "hard" | "soft" | "note";
interface Violation {
  ruleId: string; severity: Severity; description: string;

`RuleContext` (built once per `validate()` call, `buildContext()`): node/edge
lookups, `degree()`, `is.{circulation,outdoor,bathroom,bedroom,kitchen,living,
recreation,room,stair,roomOrStair,public,habitable}` type predicates,
`entryIds`, `hasEntrance`, `reachableFrom(seeds, blocked?)` (multi-source BFS,
the reachability primitive every H*/G*/ST* rule uses).

### Project file (`projectIO.ts`)
```ts
interface InstanceData { type: string; cx: number; cz: number; rotation: number }
interface EntranceData { cx: number; cz: number; side: Side }
interface FloorData { cols: number; rows: number; instances: InstanceData[]; entrances: EntranceData[] }
interface ProjectFile { format: string; version: number; floors: FloorData[] }
```
`PROJECT_FORMAT = "flat-configurator-project"`, `APP_PROJECT_VERSION = 1`.
Tolerant/versioned load (`parseProject`); NOT serialized: camera state, active
floor, per-floor visibility (all view state — see §5) — a load always starts
all floors visible at the default axo extent.

### Voxel prop JSON format (`voxelProp.ts`, `data/*.json`)
```jsonc
{
  "format": "voxel-prop",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "counter_run",        // reliable id (counter_run, overhead_cabinet, stove, sink, fridge)
  "size": [width, height, depth],
  "voxels": [ { "x": -12, "y": 0, "z": -5, "color": "#6e4a2a" }, ... ]
}
```
- Integers in **5 cm units**; **12 voxels = one 0.6 m cell** (`VOXELS_PER_CELL = 12`, `VOXEL_SIZE = 0.05`).
- Integer = voxel **min corner** (occupies `[c, c+1]`).
- **x, z centred on 0**; **y floor-anchored** (y=0 ground, up positive). High-y is baked in (overhead cabinet y≈30–41).
- Parsed to `VoxelProp { name, size, voxels:[{x,y,z,color:number}], maxZ }`; library `PROP_LIBRARY: Record<name, VoxelProp>`.

---

## 4. Conventions & decisions

- **0.6 m structural cell = 12 voxels @ 5 cm.** Structural grid uses `CELL_SIZE = 0.6`; authored props use `VOXEL_SIZE = 0.05`, so `VOXELS_PER_CELL = 12`.
- **One shared occupancy map per floor** for rooms, furniture modules, AND stairs — collision is checked uniformly. Owned by `Grid`; mutated only via `ModuleStore`. A stair's footprint additionally reserves a matching hole (`Grid.holeCells`) on the floor directly above.
- **Clusters: full rebuild from occupancy.** Circulation/Outdoor cluster shells (and the adjacency graph) are recomputed from scratch on every change (`store.onChange`), not incrementally. Same-type only, orthogonal (4-neighbour) adjacency; corner-only contact does not connect (`connectedComponents` in `core/cluster.ts` is the single definition, shared by clusters and the graph).
- **Touch-based adjacency, not door-based.** Graph edges connect rooms/clusters/stairs whose footprints share a wall (orthogonally adjacent cells). Door/opening-based adjacency is deferred (`viaDoor` reserved).
- **Windows: derived, not stored** (§2d). Regenerated from room type + exterior edges on every wall rebuild (they ride the wall pass), on EXTERIOR edges only. Nothing serialized — export/import reproduces identical windows. Panel/glazing heights are absolute (fixed on taller floors), which is why walls must be true-height geometry (§2b). Doors / interior openings are a deliberate LATER task; where an entrance coincides with a windowed edge the door wins (that edge is skipped).
- **The adjacency graph spans the whole dwelling** (all floors), not just the active one — cross-floor reachability is carried by `viaStair` edges (§2c). Entrances are floor-0-only and re-validated every build (never cached/stale).
- **Graph view recomputes per-frame while open** (cheap at this scale) → live updates; node positions persist by id across recomputes.
- **Rule validation is on-demand and advisory** (never blocks placement) — click "Check Layout" to run `validate()`; results surface in the text panel, the bubble diagram, and 3D shell tinting simultaneously. Any layout change drops the (now possibly stale) report (`floors.onLayoutChange`).
- **Wall height is real, true-height geometry; stair height is a runtime rescale** — deliberately different, see §2a/§2b. Walls are rebuilt (`rebuildRoomWalls()`/`rebuildClusterShells()`) directly at `floorHeight(floor)` on every layout change, so `scale.y === 1` always. Stairs stay built at `REFERENCE_STAIR_RISE` and rescaled via `group.scale.y` (`updateStairScales()`) — a taller floor genuinely means taller risers, so scaling is the correct model there, not a workaround.
- **Floor visibility is pure VIEW state, not design state** — never serialized (mirrors the pre-existing exclusion of camera state). Independent of the active-floor dim concept: dimming still draws a floor (colour-faded); hiding skips it entirely (`group.visible = false`). The active floor CAN be hidden (not force-switched) since interaction is scoped to the active floor's store regardless of what's drawn.
- **Undo/redo is snapshot-based, not command-based** (§2e) — this works precisely BECAUSE design state is tiny/serializable and derived state rebuilds from it (the same reasons cluster shells / windows are derived). A snapshot is a serialized project; a restore is the import rebuild path. VIEW state (camera, active floor, visibility, plan mode, selection) is deliberately outside history and preserved across restores. A commit is a no-op when the serialized state didn't change, so failed/degenerate actions cost nothing.
- **Prop seating:** prop voxels that fall inside a wall strip are clipped (`insideWall` in `place.ts`), so furniture sits flush against wall inner faces, never through walls.
- **Inactive floors:** rendered dimmed via opaque colour-fade toward the background (NOT alpha transparency — avoids depth-sort "slicing" artifacts) and are non-interactive (picker only ever raycasts the ACTIVE floor's store). Multi-colour voxel props are flagged `noDim` (not faded).

## 5. View / navigation (zoom-to-extent, floor visibility, plan view)

Added this session; all three interlock (floor visibility feeds the extent
box; the extent box feeds both axo and plan framing; plan mode drives floor
visibility). See `main.ts`'s "Camera framing" / "Plan (top) view" / "Bubble-
diagram" sections for the concrete wiring — the three toggle points (Reset
View, Top View, Diagram) are all mutually aware of each other's state.

- **Zoom-to-extent.** `FloorManager.contentBox(): THREE.Box3` unions the
  world-space bounding box of every placed instance's group + each visible
  floor's non-empty `clusterGroup`, across floors where `f.visible` is true.
  Falls back to those floors' grid footprints if nothing is placed, and
  further to a small box at the origin if no floor is visible at all. Forces
  `scene.updateMatrixWorld(true)` first — `Box3.setFromObject` reads
  `matrixWorld` directly, which can be stale if read in the same synchronous
  tick as a floor reposition (matrixWorld otherwise only refreshes on the next
  render pass; discovered and fixed this session).
- **Framing.** `sceneSetup.ts`'s `frameBox(box, direction)` (`ViewDirection =
  "axo" | "top"`) replaced the old fixed-position `resetView()`. Projects the
  box's 8 corners onto the chosen view's right/up axes (handles the axo case,
  where the box is seen at an angle, not just face-on) to find the required
  frustum half-extents, sets `viewSize`/position/target with a 15% margin
  (`FRAME_MARGIN`), and always resets `camera.zoom` to 1. For `"top"`,
  `camera.up` is swapped to world `-Z` (north-up) instead of `(0,1,0)` —
  looking straight down with an up vector parallel to the look direction is a
  singularity for OrbitControls' spherical math.
- **Reset View** (`main.ts`'s `resetToExtent()`) always lands at the default
  axo extent framing — including from plan/diagram mode, which it exits first
  (`exitPlanMode()` already re-frames axo). One button, one destination.
- **Floor visibility.** `Floor.visible` / `Floor.setVisible()` (getter/setter
  over `group.visible`); `FloorManager.setFloorVisible(i, v)` /
  `isFloorVisible(i)`. An eye-icon toggle sits next to each floor tab in
  `palette.ts` (`FloorState.floors[i].visible`,
  `PaletteCallbacks.onToggleFloorVisibility`). Default visible; not
  serialized (§3).
- **Plan (top) view.** `main.ts` state: `planMode: boolean`,
  `prePlanVisibility: boolean[]` (snapshotted on entry). `enterPlanMode()`
  exits diagram mode first, snapshots current visibility, hides every floor
  ABOVE the active one (`applyPlanVisibility()`), sets
  `controls.enableRotate = false` (pan/zoom stay live — rotation is locked so
  the plan reading can't be orbited into an oblique half-plan view), and
  frames top-down. `exitPlanMode()` restores the snapshot, unlocks rotate, and
  re-frames axo. Switching the active floor while in plan mode re-derives the
  hidden set live (`onSwitchFloor` calls `applyPlanVisibility()`); manually
  toggling a floor's eye icon while in plan mode updates the snapshot too (so
  exiting doesn't discard it). Mutually exclusive with the bubble-diagram view
  in both directions (each entry point exits the other first).
- **Cutaway needed no changes for plan mode**: wall normals are always in the
  XZ plane, so their dot product with a straight-down view direction is
  always ~0 (never exceeds the hide threshold) — every wall stays visible,
  which already reads correctly as a plan (walls seen edge-on, floor slabs
  filling the middle).

---

## 6. Current state — built/verified vs. not

**Built & verified across recent sessions (quantitatively, via temporary debug
hooks — screenshot tooling was unreliable in this dev environment, so
verification leaned on exact geometry/state dumps rather than visual
screenshots):**
- Wall height (§2b): walls build directly at the true floor-to-floor height
  on every layout change, room shells AND cluster shells — no `scale.y`
  hack (an earlier version of the fix used a rescale pass; superseded this
  session by true-height geometry). Verified `scale.y === 1` on every wall
  mesh, zero gap to the plate above, concave corners unaffected, cutaway
  unaffected, selection/dim tinting survives an in-place wall rebuild.
- Stair top-wedge fix (§2a): flight-1 winding corrected; verified via riser
  normal direction and a watertightness raycast sweep.
- Zoom-to-extent, Reset View, floor visibility, plan/top view (§5): verified
  content-box framing changes with placed content and floor visibility,
  plan-mode auto-hide/restore across floor switches, mutual exclusivity with
  diagram mode, and that visibility never survives a save/load round-trip.
- Rule-driven windows (§2d, W1): verified per-type generation (living
  full-height, bedroom framed, kitchen fixed 2-edge, bathroom none); the
  2-edge minimum (computed-1 rounds to 2, no single-edge windows); bands
  centred on the longest run, no corner wrap; move/rotate regenerates windows
  on the new exterior edges; cutaway hides panels + glass together with their
  face; entrance-coincident edge skipped (door wins); W1 fires on
  insufficient supply (and independently of D1); export/import reproduces
  identical windows; selection tints panels (shared material) while glass
  stays separate, glass dims with its floor.
- Undo/redo + entrance deletion (§2e/§2f): verified a 15+ mixed-action
  sequence undoes to the empty baseline and redoes to the exact original final
  (incl. derived walls/glass/clusters and floor/stair reconstruction);
  undo/redo are symmetric; a new action after undo clears redo; camera, active
  floor, and per-floor visibility are untouched by undo; a real drag commits
  exactly once (no per-frame snapshots; an invalid drop commits nothing); a
  collision-blocked rotate correctly records nothing; entrance select (real
  projected click → highlight) + Delete removes it and is undoable; deleting
  the last entrance empties `entryIds` and restores the E1 gate with no stale
  report; Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y + buttons all track stack state.

**Also built (from earlier sessions, still current):**
- Grid, occupancy, placement, rotate, move, delete; grid resize with reconcile.
- All room presets render as clean hollow shells; concave corners z-fight-free.
- Dynamic cutaway hides camera-facing walls reactively (rooms + clusters).
- Multi-floor stacking, floor tabs, add/delete, per-floor grid size,
  dim/non-interactive inactive floors.
- Circulation & Outdoor merged cluster shells (outer walls only; same-type
  only; split on deletion).
- Kitchen voxel props (counter_run, overhead_cabinet, stove, sink, fridge).
- **Stairs**: 180° dogleg, footprint 2×6, cuts/restores a matching stairwell
  hole in the floor above, auto-creates a floor above when placed on the
  topmost floor, blocked if the floor above has no clear plate.
- **Entrances**: ground-floor door markers bound to an exterior edge,
  re-validated every graph build, root reachability. Selectable + deletable
  (§2f): click to select, Delete to remove; place + delete are undoable.
- **Undo / redo** (§2e): snapshot-based (cap 20), Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z /
  Ctrl+Y + bottom-left buttons; covers place/move/rotate/delete, entrance
  add/delete, floor add/delete, grid resize, import; view state excluded.
- **Whole-dwelling adjacency graph** (all floors, cross-floor stair edges) +
  toggleable bubble-diagram view (per-floor, entry rings, stair stubs, depth
  badges, highlight overlays).
- **Layout rules engine**: 25 rules (see §8), advisory/on-demand, surfaced in
  a text report, the diagram, and 3D shell/marker tinting.
- **Rule-driven windows** (§2d): derived sill/lintel panels + glazing on
  exterior edges, per-type ratio targets, W1 shortfall rule.
- **Save / load**: whole-project JSON export/import, drag-and-drop, tolerant/
  versioned parsing.

**Not built:**
- Furniture for rooms other than Kitchen — all other rooms are empty shells
  (only `kitchen` has a `PROP_BUILDERS` entry).
- Door/opening system — doors and INTERIOR openings are a deliberate later
  task (windows §2d cover exterior edges only; interior walls stay full
  solid). `GraphEdge.viaDoor` and `ModuleDef.connectionEdges` remain reserved
  scaffolding, unread by any logic.

**Known minor issue (deferred):** connector pieces are selected by clicking
their floor tile; their merged cluster walls live in a shared `clusterGroup`
and are not individually pickable — clicking a cluster wall doesn't select a
specific piece.

**Uncommitted at time of writing:** modified `index.html`,
`src/core/adjacencyGraph.ts`, `src/core/exteriorEdges.ts`, `src/core/floor.ts`,
`src/core/floorManager.ts`, `src/core/rules.ts`, `src/core/store.ts`,
`src/interaction/dragDrop.ts`, `src/interaction/selection.ts`, `src/main.ts`,
`src/scene/clusterShells.ts`, `src/scene/entranceView.ts`,
`src/scene/moduleMesh.ts`, `src/scene/sceneSetup.ts`, `src/scene/stairMesh.ts`,
`src/style.css`, `src/ui/palette.ts`; new untracked `CLAUDE.md`,
`src/core/windows.ts`, `src/core/history.ts` — the wall-height fix (true-height
geometry), view/navigation features, stair geometry fix, the rule-driven
window system (§2d), and undo/redo + entrance deletion (§2e/§2f) described
above. Run `git status` to confirm before assuming this list is still current.

## 7. Future extension points (scaffolding already in place)

- **Door-based adjacency:** `GraphEdge.viaDoor?: boolean` is reserved; a later
  pass can set it without redesigning the edge model. `ConnectionEdge` on
  `ModuleDef` (per-side, `allowed`, future entry point/span) is scaffolded but
  unused.
- **Facade/window placement:** reuse `exteriorEdges()` (already the shared
  primitive for entrance placement, entrance validity, and D1/D2) to place
  windows/doors on a room's exterior edges.
- **Furnishing the remaining rooms:** the prop system is room-agnostic
  (`place.ts` helpers + `PROP_BUILDERS` registry). Add a layout module per
  room type + a registry entry; no engine changes needed.
- **Cluster-wall selection friction** (see §6) — make cluster walls map back
  to a piece if desired.
- **Space-syntax depth metric** (`computeEntranceDepths`) is deliberately
  decoupled from the violation list — kept as a standalone reusable function
  in case future analysis wants the raw per-room hop counts.

## 8. Layout rules — current table (`src/core/rules.ts`)

All rules are **advisory** (never block placement), run on-demand via
"Check Layout", and read the whole-dwelling graph (§2c/§3). Severity: 🔴 hard,
🟡 soft, 🟢 note. This table must match `RULES` in `rules.ts` exactly — if
you add/remove/reword a rule, update this table in the same change.

**Entrance validity**
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | 🟢 note | Place an entrance to validate circulation/reachability. |
| E2 | 🔴 hard | Entrance is blocked — its edge no longer faces outside. |

**Program completeness**
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | 🔴 hard | A dwelling needs a bathroom. |
| P2 | 🔴 hard | A dwelling needs a kitchen. |
| P3 | 🟢 note | More than one kitchen — atypical, but not a problem. |

**Reachability** (entrance-rooted, whole dwelling, across stairs — corridors NOT required)
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | 🔴 hard | Orphaned room — no path of adjacencies (including stairs) reaches an entrance. |
| H2 | 🔴 hard | A room or stair reachable from an entrance only by passing through a bathroom. |
| H3 | 🔴 hard | A room or stair reachable from an entrance only by passing through a bedroom. |
| H6 | 🔴 hard | A room or stair reachable from an entrance only by passing through an outdoor space. |
| ST2 | 🔴 hard | Stair not reachable from any entrance. |

*(H5 does not exist — ids are not contiguous; do not add one without a reason.)*

**Adjacency / privacy**
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| H4 | 🔴 hard | Bathroom directly adjacent to a kitchen. |
| S3 | 🟡 soft | Bedroom directly adjacent to a kitchen, living room, or recreation room. |
| S4 | 🟡 soft | Two bedrooms directly adjacent. |
| S5 | 🟢 note | Kitchen and living room adjacent — open-plan; noted, not a problem. |
| G1 | 🟡 soft | No bathroom is reachable without passing through a bedroom (guest access). |
| G2 | 🟡 soft | Entrance opens directly into a private room (bedroom or bathroom). |

**Corridor justification** (circulation clusters)
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | 🔴 hard | Orphaned corridor — connects to nothing (dead space). |
| C2 | 🟡 soft | Under-used corridor — connects to only one space. |

**Stairs**
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ST1 | 🟡 soft | Stair connects to nothing on one or both floors it should link. |
| ST2 | 🔴 hard | (see Reachability above) |

**Daylight / ventilation / glazing** (D1/D2 reuse `GraphNode.hasExteriorEdge`, §2c; W1 reuses `GraphNode.glazing`, §2d)
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | 🔴 hard | Habitable room (bedroom, living room, or recreation room) has no exterior wall. |
| D2 | 🟡 soft | Kitchen has no exterior wall. |
| W1 | 🟡 soft | Room's glazing is below its daylight target (incl. zero windows because no ≥2-edge straight exterior run exists). |

**Room-count / connectivity balance**
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | 🟡 soft | Outdoor/balcony over-connected (>2 adjacencies) — usually a leaf space. |
| S2 | 🟡 soft | Living room under-connected (≤1 adjacency) — typically a social hub. |

**Space-syntax depth** (informational metric, `computeEntranceDepths`, §3)
| ID | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| DP1 | 🟡 soft | Room is unusually deep in the layout (≥`DEEP_ROOM_THRESHOLD_HOPS` = 5 hops from the entrance). |

Recreation Room is classified as **public/social** (`ctx.is.public`, same
category as Living Room) for the privacy rules, and as **habitable**
(`ctx.is.habitable`, same category as Bedroom + Living Room) for D1.
